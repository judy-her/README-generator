## Description

This application is a README.md generator. It is easy to use and can be invoked using the command line. Its purpose is to give web developers more time to focus on coding by spending less time creating a README file from scratch. This README generator comes with ready made prompts for all sections of a professional README file. All you need to do is answer the questions as they appear in the command line. This README generator comes with four licenses you can choose, which include Apache,MIT, GNU GPL, and LGPL. Each license comes with its own badge and link. You also have the option of not using a license.
